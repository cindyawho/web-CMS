            "spoilers":"The three heroes chosen initially for the mission was no surprise to me: Senku as the scientist, Ryusui as the pilot, and Kohaku as the warrior. But! I was very surprised that Ryusui gave up his spot for Stanley Snyder! Who is a better shot and as good a pilot as Ryusui. That was wild, but very sweet of Ryusui."

            "spoilers":"I wanted to see more scenes with her powers of Death. I also had a feeling Blythe was the one with powers of Life and while she's a spunky character, I felt like the story moved much slower with her perspective and would have preferred if it was just Signa. But I guess to set up the next book Blythe had to be a larger part of this book. Aris, or Fate, is annoying and I don't prefer him at all even as the 'villain' lol."
