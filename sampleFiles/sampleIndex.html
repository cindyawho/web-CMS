                <p class="latestDescription">While the book moved a bit slow, the challenges that Signa face involve an interesting dynamic. If you're into slow-paced gothic books, try it out! </p>
                <p class="spoilers">Hover to read spoilers: <span>I wanted to see more scenes with her powers of Death. I also had a feeling Blythe was the one with powers of Life and while she's a spunky character, I felt like the story moved much slower with her perspective and would have preferred if it was just Signa. But I guess to set up the next book Blythe had to be a larger part of this book. Aris, or Fate, is annoying and I don't prefer him at all even as the 'villain' lol.</span></p>
