				<p class='latestDescription'>My Thoughts on the Book: While the book moved a bit slow, the challenges that Signa face involve an interesting dynamic. If you're into slow-paced gothic books, try it out!

				<p class='spoilers'>Hover to read spoilers: <span>I wanted to see more scenes with her powers of Life and Death. While Blythe is a spunky character, I felt like the story moved much slower with her perspective and would have preferred if it was just Signa and her exploring her powers. Aris, or Fate, is annoying and I don't prefer him at all, but every story needs a bad guy I guess.
