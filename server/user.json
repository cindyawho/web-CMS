If you're into slow-paced gothic books, try it out!", "spoilers": "I wanted to see more scenes with her powers of Life and Death. While Blythe is a spunky character, I felt like the story moved much slower with her perspective and would have preferred if it was just Signa and her exploring her powers. Aris, or Fate, is annoying and I don't prefer him at all, but every story needs a bad guy I guess."}], "footerDescription": "Want to talk books? Send me an email at example@pcc.edu!"}
